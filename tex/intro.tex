\sec Project Aims

The aim of this project is the development of the Atlas of Human Bones, an online database of bones including 3D models with labels and web pages with additional information. Presentation of the content is only one part of the application though, as the content needs to be editable by medical experts without a technical background.

The Atlas will serve as a source of information and a study material, primarily for students of the Third Faculty of Medicine at Charles University in Prague.

Our first task before we can begin development is to define the key features necessary to make the application truly useful for medical students. Then we need to compare the concept with existing solutions to see if it brings anything new. Since this project has a predecessor implementing some of the features, it needs to be analyzed to find out whether it can be upgraded or a complete redesign is necessary.

The next step is researching available technologies and choosing those best suited for various parts of our application.

Then we must properly design a sustainable web application, which requires identifying the application’s use cases, identifying relevant business objects and creating a data model, designing a user interface and modeling the internal structure of the application.

Once the design is ready, we need to implement it.

After the implementation is complete and its functionality verified, it should be deployed to a server and tested with regular users as well as editors. The application may then be improved according to user feedback if time permits.


\sec Project Background

The Third Faculty of Medicine at Charles University in Prague is a successful, established educational institution. Its Department of Anatomy, as many others before, have realized the great potential of computer technologies in education and started numerous projects to transfer knowledge from traditional printed sources to a much more flexible online domain. One of these projects was an online atlas of human bones.

This project was initiated in 2012 by doc. MUDr. Václav Báča, Ph.D., at the time a faculty member of the Department of Anatomy. The project aimed to create an online 3D database of human bones, which would be an exhaustive yet illustrative source of information for medical students. The goal was not only to display 3D models, but also to provide numerous labels with descriptions of relevant structures of each bone.

I developed the first, rather imperfect (see \ref[old_atlas]) version of the Atlas in 2013 and the Third Faculty of Medicine provided the content.

Working on this project as a part of my master’s thesis finally gave me the necessary amount of time to give the Atlas a long due redesign.
