\abstractEN {The topic of this project is the development of a web application which displays 3D models of human bones with labels identifying their important parts, while additional information about each bone is provided in form of text and images. This application will be used by students of the Third Medical Faculty of Charles University in Prague for educational purposes. An important feature of this application is an editorial interface, which lets medical experts without technical background edit the content. To create this application, technologies suitable for the task were researched and best candidates were chosen (WebGL via {\tt three.js}, Java EE with JSF). The application had to be properly designed before implementation: its use cases and business objects identified, user interface drafted and its object-oriented structure modeled. The application was implemented according to the design and after its use cases were verified, it was deployed to a production server. To evaluate the quality of both public and editorial interfaces, several editors were asked to prepare example content, which was afterwards presented to medical students. Positive feedback was received from editors as well as uninvolved users.}
