help.model.title=Viewing Models
help.model.text=To view our 3D models you're going to need a browser supporting WebGL. You can find out whether your browser supports WebGL <a href="http://get.webgl.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.\n\nIf a page contains a 3D model and your browser supports WebGL, the 3D scene will become an interactive component of the page.\n\nIf you're seeing a "LOADING" sign in place of the model, the model is still downloading. Some models are rather large and might take a while to download.\n\nThere are several ways to manipulate the scene: \n<ul><li><b>Rotate</b> the view by dragging the left mouse button</li>\n<li><b>Pan</b> the view by dragging the right mouse button</li>\n<li><b>Zoom</b> with the mouse wheel</li></ul>\nYou can select display mode of the model's labels in the top right corner of the scene.\n\nEach label can be selected by clicking its tag or red marking point. That opens a detailed description if available. You can unselect the label by clicking it again, or you can simply select another label by clicking that instead.
help.language.title=Language Selection
help.language.text=You can easily change the site's language by clicking the small flags in top right corner. Please note that not all pages are necessarily available in all language variants.
help.login.title=Login
help.login.text=You don't need to login to browse and view the content. The login feature is mostly meant for the page's editors. If you are an editor having trouble with login, please contact the site administrator.
